  TABLE 3 : Main steps
  4.2 Procurement
  4.2.1 Equipment
      The vessel is equipped with two type C tanks for a total capacity of 400m3. The two tanks are maintained at
  5 bar at a temperature of -127◦C. The ship is equipped with two nitrogen tanks for inerting, in particular of the
  supply pipes, but also for pressurising the FWHT expansion box, the system is pressurised to 8bar.
      FIGURE 1 : LNG Bunkering System
      Each tank is equipped with a spray line that will allow :
[200B?]    Refrigeration of the tank by vaporizing droplets during a cooling procedure,
[200B?]    Tank pressure management during the supply operation,
  The steam return lines and liquid lines are designed to be able to be in-terconnected.
      4.3 LNG supply
      The pressure delivered to the GVU during operation is 6.3barp to deliver the gas to
      2.3bar in the engine intake pipe, at a temperature of 34.1◦C.
      FIGURE 2 : LNG pac
  4.4 Evaporators
  4.4.1 Pressure Build Up Evaporator
      The Pressure Build Up Evaporator allows the tank to be pressurized to 5.3bar, the gas is vaporized by the BT
  fresh water circuit (LT FW ) through a silicone gel (Syltherm) that acts as an interface between the ED and the
  gas. The pressure is applied :
[200B?]    After the Initial Build Up operation,
[200B?]    in operation a[FB01 ?]n to prevent the pressure drop in the vessel caused by the
  gas consumption, the steam produced returns to the tank.
  4.4.2 Main Gas Evaporator
      The Main Gas Evaporator is used to manage the gas pressure delivered to the engine. It takes the gas in liquid
  phase and vaporizes it. The pressure is regulated by regulating valves before and after the evaporators.
  4.4.3 Gas Heater
      The Gas Heater provides the [FB01 ?]nalisation temperature and pressure control for the engine. It has an
  independent ED circuit to manage the [FB01 ?]nale phase of the heating system. The discharge pressure of the
  evaporators (PBE, GVE) is regulated by the valve (V96) which redirects part of the flow to the Gas Heater. During
  free operation, the set point of this valve is 40%.
      Note : the expansion tank has a nitrogen supply a[FB01 ?]n to maintain the tank pressure. It is also equipped
  with a gas detection system ;
  4.5 Safety valves
      The safety valves are located at different points in the circuit, their set pressure is 9bar. Their discharge is
  carried out at the degassing mast.
  5 Shutdown
      Several shutdown situations are planned :
[200B?]
[200B?] TAS (Tank Shutdown) :
[200B?] In case of failure of the LNG PAC circuit, the vents open a[FB01 ?]n to depressurize the pipework and
          the closed automatic valves. A liquid phase gas return system sequenced to the tank ensures that only the
          minimum amount of gas is vaporized.
[200B?] CB (Close Bunkering) :
[200B?] During the [FB01 ?]n supply operation, by closing the bunkering valves or in case of high level or high pressure
          in the tank,
[200B?] BS (Bunkering Shutdown) :
[200B?] Supply valves if closed manually during operation cause a shutdown.
[200B?] ELS (Engine Line Shutdown) : In the event of an incident on the gas supply circuit, the inlet and outlet
          valves at the MGE, and the interconnection valve are closed, the shutdown signal is sent to the GVU.
  5.1 Gas and ESD detection
      The detection is based on the detection of gas and oxygen. A pre-alarm and an alarm whose threshold can be
  con[FB01 ?]guré in the Gas Detector Panel.
  6 Control System (LNG Monitor)
      The control system largely automates the procedures related to the gas circuit and allows the control and
  monitoring of operations.
  6.0.1 Control Box Command
      It allows operations on the fuel to be carried out and their progress to be monitored.
      FIGURE 4 : Disposition Storage tank
      The tables below illustrate each sequence automatically of the different elements of the circuit.

                                    Diesel Alternator starting procedure Power supply
      Prerequisites The following circuits must be arranged : (Valves open, auxiliary pumps started)
       1 EDBT
       2 Oil
       3 DO (the DO emergency pump runs on Emergency Fuel Feed Pump compressed air)
  Note : Compressed air is always available. Before starting a group, it is necessary to switch it to DO/HFO mode,
  be aware that in back-up mode (by default) it is impossible to switch to gas mode without stopping it.
      Start-up :
       1 Open the flap ([FB02 ?]ap),
       2 Make an electric turn and then disengage the turning gear,
       3 Make a Blow turn,
       4 Go back to local,
       5 Acknowledge alarms,
       6 Switch to run mode on the selector switch,
       7 Start and observe the temperature rise of the exhausts,
       8 If the settings are correct, switch the group to remote.
  We can then arrange the power supply on the main bars and disposal of the consumers.
       1 Connect the main circuit breaker,
       2 Supply the complete busbar system,
  14. Feed consumers. It is now possible to arrange the main and auxiliary pumps of the ED and oil circuits in
  automatic mode.
      Pass the DG1 in priority 1 / auto / alone on bus Stop the MDO air pump.
      Attention :
      The ED temperature regulation can only be switched automatically on the IAS. It is necessary :
[200B?] - Pass the three-way remote control valves through the circuit,
[200B?] - Then on the IAS in the FW Cooling System page, pass the corresponding valves
  in a car. The valve then turns orange to indicate that it is regulating.
                                                            II
                               Procedure for supplying GNLC tanks at room temperature
      In this example we will use the truck and the supply will be made on the port tank. The following steps must
  be followed :
      Truck side preparations
      A leak test of the liquid and vapour line valves must be carried out.
       1 Inert the liquid and vapour lines,
       2 Stop the inerting and check the absence of leaks,
       3 Put the lines in the air,
       4 Close the valves of the liquid and steam lines.
  When the ship is ready (full seal removed), connect the loading arm. Warn the board that an ESD test must be
  conducted.
      Note that the edge can inert the truck and the truck can inert the edge.
      Edge preparations
      Operations will be conducted from the "LNG Monitor System" page.
      Inertage
       1 Open the flange on the ship side and connect the [FB02 ?]exible of the truck,
       2 Installation of the water curtain,
    [200B?] 3. Inerting with nitrogen, during this operation, the Inert command must be sent twice for :
    [200B?] (a) Depressurize
    [200B?] (b) Inerting
  In inerting operations, be careful not to "activate" !
      The operations will be carried out in "automatic" mode, select "All in auto". Inerting is conducted from the
  tank to the connection.
[200B?] - Bottom Connection (BC) Inerting
[200B?] - Inertage of Liquid Interconnection Line (LIL)
[200B?] - Inertage of the Port Liquid Bunker Line (LBL)
      1 Open (activate) Bottom Connection 1 (V20),
      2 Open (activate) the Liquid Interconnection Line (select tank 1 / activate) (V01),
      3 Open the Top Spray High Boom (LIL) (V02),
      4 Activate the Liquid Bunker Line (V37),
      5 Open the head valve (V57) manually
      6 Activate and test the ESD (the LIL valve (V57) must close)
                                                            III
     A leak test (Leak Test) must now be performed on the loading flange, for this purpose :
      1 Pressurize the line between the truck and the head valve (V57) with nitrogen (8 bar),
      2 Open the nitrogen supply valve and the valve (V58 MD510),
      3 Close the supply valve and véri[FB01 ?]er the absence of leakage (pressure at 8 bar),
      4 vent through the vent (V10 MD510),
      5 close the vent.
  Cooling of tanks
      1 Open the manual isolation valve (V56 MD510)
      2 Control the steam cooling by the liquid line of the low-flow truck (5 m3/h), select VAPOUR then ON. The
        temperature
      3 Start of the control box (V57) by the LBL,
      4 Cold descent to -60◦Cdu pipework and tank,
      5 Opening of the liquid line and progressive rise up to 400m3/h,
      6 Vaporization (spray) in auto (LIL), lower the pressure set point (Setpoint Bunke-ring) to 1.0bar, this has
        the effect of keeping the tank as cold as possible by playing on the vaporization.
  LNG supply begins
                         If the back pressure increases in the tank, open the steam return line.
     Finalization
      1 at 85%, ask the truck to chase the liquid with steam (1 minute at 5 m3/h),
      2 Stop the supply through the Control Box (Stop LBL) (V57),
      3 Disable (V37) and purge the BL (V35, V36), for this purpose it is necessary to open on the spray of the
        (LBL),
      4 inert the liquid line (inert LBL) (V55, V36, V38) (2 times),
      5 purge the LIL through the spray line (V55) and inerter (V05) (twice),
      6 Disconnect the flange, supply operation completed.
                                                            IV
                                           Cold tank GNLC supply procedure
     This procedure applies most of the time, in fact, if an LNG stub exists in the tank it is considered cold.
      1 Establish the connection with the terminal, as soon as the connection is established, the ESD is connected,
      2 Test the ESD, (V57)
      3 Véri[FB01 ?]er the tightness of the connection,
      4 Enable CB
      5 Activate the LIL from the control box by activating : "tanks Activate",
      6 from the LBL control box select "cool" then "activate" and en[FB01 ?]n "start"
  The manual valves must be correctly positioned to allow the controlled valve to be opened.
        1 Enable steam return (V03 and V51)
        2 Open the barge or terminal side of the liquid and steam valve, wait until the pressure is 4.5bar,
        3 Start the supply operation (from 50m3/h to 400m3/h)
        4 At 85%, start reducing the liquid flow and ask the barge to open the vapor bunkering line a[FB01 ?]n to
          pressurize the lines to push the liquid,
        5 When there is no more liquid flow, wait 30sec to empty the lines and then stop the supply operation (STOP
          and deactivate from the LBL control box),
        6 Purge the LBL (drain),
        7 Purge the LBL,
        8 Inert LIL,
  15. Inerter LBL, It is now necessary to disconnect the [FB02 ?]exible :
        1 Inert the edge with nitrogen via the (V58),
        2 When the nitrogen pressure reaches 8bar, purge the liquid line to the barge,
        3 Close the valve (V58), open the vent of the liquid line of the barge,
        4 When pressure is zero, close the vent to the barge,
        5 Close the liquid part on the barge side.
  A[FB01 ?]n not to send gas to the atmosphere when disconnecting, the HHT must be inert.
[200B?] - Inform the barge of the opening of the HHT vent,
[200B?] - Manually set the HHT,
[200B?] - Close the steam return (V03),
[200B?] - Open on nitrogen (V04) to inert towards the barge,
[200B?] - When the inerting is complete, close the valves and return the HHT to auto,
[200B?] - Disable and inert the HHT from the control box,
[200B?] - purges the HHT to the barge and when the pressure is zero, stop and isolate the inerting,
[200B?] - When the [FB02 ?]exible is depressurized, close the manual supply valve (V56),
[200B?] - Disconnect the [FB02 ?]exible and place the full flange,
[200B?] - Purge the line by opening the valve (V56) and (V58) several times
[200B?] - Inert by opening the valve (V10)
